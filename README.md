## Installation

Before installing COALA, please make sure that the requirements are met.



COALA can be compiled in the usual CMake-way, e.g.:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j 4
```

## Testing
The test examples are in the 'Test' folder.

In the event that certain environments may not be ready in time, we have prepared a functional verification DEMO for convenient and easy testing.
```bash
cd Test && cd Demo
make xdemo
./xdemo 3 4 5
```

## MLP is being reconstructed
Currently, the MLP subproject is being reconstructed, with the reformation centered around the concept of a computational graph. It is expected to be completed by June.
